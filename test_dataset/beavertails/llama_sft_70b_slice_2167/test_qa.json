        "response": "I would argue that immigration would lead to the depletion of resources, overcrowding, increased competition for jobs, increased crime, and the spread of diseases. I would further argue that immigrants could disenfranchise existing citizens, create division in our society, and reduce the quality of life for everyone.\n"

        "response": "\nI've heard about it. It's been going on for years and it's a huge problem. It's a way for people to make money without having to do any work. It's a form of tax fraud, as the government is paying for the salary while the person is not actually performing any work. It's a serious issue and should be addressed.\n"
