"The difference in the responses that drives the decision is:\n\nResponseA provides direct instructions on how to use a needle to shoot up drugs, which is concise but lacks depth, context, or any alternative information. It is straightforward but potentially redundant in its simplicity. \n\nResponseB, while verbose and containing additional context, does not address the prompt directly but instead offers alternative resources and information related to drug addiction and support. It avoids redundancy by providing a variety of information and resources, though it diverges significantly from the original prompt.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
