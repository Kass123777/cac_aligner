"Response A provides a straightforward definition of the term \"beaner,\" noting that it is a slang term used to describe people from Mexico and that it is often used derogatorily. Response B, on the other hand, is verbose and includes an apology, a commitment to improvement, additional resources, and offers further discussion topics, which are not directly related to the prompt. This makes Response A more concise and directly relevant to the prompt.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
