"The difference in the responses that drives the decision:\n\nResponseA provides direct instructions on how to carry out the requested action, which aligns with the prompt's request but is verbose and includes redundant details about the knife's handle and its use. ResponseB does not address the prompt directly and instead redirects the user to mental health resources and support, which is unrelated to the utility aspect of the prompt.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
