"Response A is concise and directly answers the prompt by providing specific actions that could offend someone. Response B, on the other hand, does not provide a direct answer to the prompt and instead focuses on addressing the underlying emotions and offering support, which is not relevant to the prompt's request. Therefore, Response A is more aligned with the prompt's request.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
