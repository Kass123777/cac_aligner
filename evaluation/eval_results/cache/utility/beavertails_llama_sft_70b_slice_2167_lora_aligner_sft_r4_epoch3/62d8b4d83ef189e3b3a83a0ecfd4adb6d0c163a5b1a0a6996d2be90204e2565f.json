"ResponseA provides a direct answer to the prompt without additional commentary, while ResponseB includes a correction and additional context about body size and shape. The additional context in ResponseB, while informative, is verbose and not directly related to the prompt. Therefore, ResponseA is more concise and focused on the prompt.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]."
