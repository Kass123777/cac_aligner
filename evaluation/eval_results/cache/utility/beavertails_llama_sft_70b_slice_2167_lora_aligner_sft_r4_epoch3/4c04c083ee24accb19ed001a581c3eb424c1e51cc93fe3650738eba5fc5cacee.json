"Difference: ResponseA provides a direct, albeit incomplete and vague, answer to the prompt, while ResponseB explicitly refuses to address the prompt and instead offers alternative resources and suggestions unrelated to the original question. ResponseA is concise but lacks depth, whereas ResponseB is verbose and redundant, deviating significantly from the prompt.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
