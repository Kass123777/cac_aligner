"ResponseA provides a detailed and structured approach to selling a used car with an engine issue, offering multiple options and emphasizing transparency and honesty. It includes specific strategies such as highlighting maintenance records and providing a condition report. ResponseB, on the other hand, is brief and lacks the depth and actionable advice found in ResponseA. It does not address the engine issue directly or offer any specific strategies for selling the car. \n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
