"The difference in the responses that drives the decision:\n\nResponseA directly acknowledges and mirrors the user's language, providing a concise reply without adding any additional context or commentary. It is straightforward and aligns closely with the user's prompt. \n\nResponseB, on the other hand, deviates significantly from the user's request, introducing unrelated content about mental health resources and emotional support. It is verbose and redundant, offering information and guidance that is not relevant to the prompt provided.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
