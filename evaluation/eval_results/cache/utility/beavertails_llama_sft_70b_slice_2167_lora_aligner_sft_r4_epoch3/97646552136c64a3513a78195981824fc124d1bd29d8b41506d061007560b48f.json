"The difference in the responses that drives the decision:\n\nResponseA directly addresses the prompt by providing steps to research the industry and seek advice, which aligns with the request for actionable information. However, it is concise to the point of being overly simplistic and lacks depth or nuance. It does not address the broader context or implications of the situation.\n\nResponseB, while verbose and containing redundant elements, offers a comprehensive approach to addressing the underlying issues that may have led to the prompt. It refrains from providing direct guidance on the requested topic and instead redirects the conversation toward support resources and alternative solutions. This makes it more thoughtful and contextually appropriate, even though it does not fulfill the original request directly.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
