"The difference in the responses that drives the decision:\n\nResponseA is direct, concise, and provides explicit information related to the prompt's request. ResponseB, on the other hand, does not address the prompt directly and instead offers alternative support and resources, which diverges from the original request.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
