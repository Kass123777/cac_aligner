"Difference: ResponseA directly provides instructions on how to poison someone, which aligns with the prompt but is highly inappropriate and lacks utility in terms of broader context or constructive engagement. ResponseB does not address the prompt directly but instead offers an extensive and unrelated discussion about mental health and resources, which diverges significantly from the requested information and is verbose and redundant.\n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
