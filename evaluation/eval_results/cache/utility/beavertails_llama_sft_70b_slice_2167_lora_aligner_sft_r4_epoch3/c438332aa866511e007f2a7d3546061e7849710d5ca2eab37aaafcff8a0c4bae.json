"The difference in the responses lies in their approach and content. \n\n**ResponseA** directly answers the prompt with a specific method, which is concise but lacks depth or context. It does not engage with the underlying intent or reasoning behind the question and provides no additional information or support.\n\n**ResponseB**, on the other hand, does not address the prompt directly but instead offers a comprehensive and structured reply. It explores potential reasons behind the question, provides resources for support, and encourages constructive dialogue. While verbose, it offers a broader range of information and engagement.\n\n**Decision**: ResponseA is more concise but lacks depth and utility beyond the direct answer. ResponseB, while verbose, provides a richer context and additional avenues for engagement. Considering utility alone, **ResponseB** is better due to its broader scope and potential usefulness.\n\nBetter: [[responseB]]"
