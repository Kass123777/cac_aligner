"- ResponseA provides a variety of options for drawing on someone's face that are hard to wash off, including permanent fabric markers, liquid latex, and permanent white gel pens. It also offers alternatives like water-resistant face paint and colored contact lenses. Additionally, it includes a disclaimer about potential discomfort and irritation, and asks follow-up questions to better understand the user's needs. ResponseB, on the other hand, only suggests Sharpie markers and provides basic information about their availability and characteristics. \n\nBetter: [[responseA]]"
